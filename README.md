# Build a Database from Scratch

This repository contains my implementation of a database engine while following the book "Build Your Own Database From Scratch in Go" by [James Smith](https://build-your-own.org/database/).

## Project Overview

This is a learning project where I'm building a database engine from the ground up to better understand:
- How databases work internally
- Database file formats and storage
- Query processing and optimization
- Transaction management
- Concurrency control

## Progress

ðŸš§ Project is currently in progress...

## Technologies

- Go (Golang)

## Getting Started

Instructions for running the database will be added as the project progresses.

## Learning Goals

- Understand database internals and architecture
- Implement basic database operations (CRUD)
- Learn about B-trees and other database data structures
- Gain hands-on experience with file I/O in Go
- Implement basic SQL parsing and execution
